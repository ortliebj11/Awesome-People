The octopus is an awesome and beautiful creature! It is the most intelligent 
animal that is most distantly related to humans, so it's basically like 
a freaky alien species that lives on Earth.

Despite our last common ancestor probably being a leech or flatworm type
creature, the octopus still evolved a complex brain and two eyes, similar
to us, but through a completely different evolutionary route.

They have been observed displaying curiosity, using tools, solving 
difficult puzzles, lockpicking, forming mental maps, and even building 
friendships with other animals.

This implies true consciousness, but since their brain evolved completely 
seperately from ours, we can never imagine how 'thinking' feels or works
for them. 

It shows me that we have no idea what intelligence really is, we can only
observe the world through our own biases. We trick ourselves into thinking
that we're experiencing the universe, but really we only experience
representations that are  processed and displayed by our human brain.

If it weren't for their tragically short 3-year lifespan and solitary life,
maybe the octopus would be the dominant species.

Oh, and they're also awesome because they can shoot ink and camoflauge!
